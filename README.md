# Java Refresher Plan
This class is helping me produce a Java Refresher Plan.
These are the things I'm going to work on.
I'll produce a Java HTTP Server and Client.

# Basic Java
* Build System: Gradle
* Unit Testing: JUnit
* Logging: Log4j
* Concurrent Programming: Threads

# Java SE 8

* Lambda Expressions
* Annotations
* Reactive Streams

# Java SE 11
This is where they gave us a new HTTP Client, so this is when I'll begin working on the server and client.

* HTTP Client
* Shebang Support

# Java 12 through 16

* Switch Expressions
* Text Blocks
* Records
* Pattern Matching for instanceof
* Sealed Classes

# Java 17
